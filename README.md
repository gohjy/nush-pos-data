# nush-pos-data
Programme of Studies data in JSON format, generated using Walnit's [nushPOSextractor tool](https://github.com/Walnit/nushPOSextractor) and converted from CSV to JSON using [csvjson.com/csv2json](https://csvjson.com/csv2json).
The POS itself in PDF format is available on the [school website](https://www.nushigh.edu.sg/studying-at-nus-high/the-nus-high-diploma/programme-of-studies/
).

*Note: I modified the nushPOSextractor tool slightly to account for some module errors (and ended up modifying one piece of module source code), but the tool itself might/should still work*

Due to the extremely infrequent nature of POS updates, you may want to consider downloading a copy and hosting it locally instead to save on both our bandwidths.
